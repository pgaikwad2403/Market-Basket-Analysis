📦 Market Basket Analysis – Product Bundling & Cross-Sell Insights


📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchase behavior using the UCI Online Retail dataset to identify frequently bought-together products and generate data-driven product bundle and cross-sell recommendations aimed at increasing Average Order Value (AOV).
Using SQL-based market basket analysis, the project calculates Support, Confidence, and Lift to uncover meaningful product associations and translate them into actionable business strategies.

🎯 Business Problem
Which products are frequently purchased together, and how can these insights be used to create product bundles and cross-sell recommendations that increase revenue?

🧠 Key Business Questions
What is the average basket size (items per order)?
Which product pairs are most frequently purchased together?
What factors drive customers to buy certain products together?
How do purchase patterns vary by country and time?
Which product bundles should be created to maximize AOV?
